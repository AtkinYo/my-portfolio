          Greetings! Iâ€™m a front-end web developer who loves solving problems to
          create intutive and responsive code that brings the web to life. Iâ€™m
          always pushing myself to understand new patterns and different ways of
          approaching a problem to improve as a web developer by staying on top
          of the latest industry standards and solving code challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
          Through my time at South Mountain Community College, I learned the
          basics of the web, such as HTML essentials, the box model, CSS
          Flexbox, CSS Grid, and building responsive mobile-first code. I've
          then jumped to Javascript where I have familiarized myself with
          ES5/ES6 standards, utilizing Async/Await to integrate APIâ€™s, DOM
          manipulation, MJML for responsive emails, Litmus for cross-platform
          testing, Git and Javascript library jQuery.
        </p>

        <p>
          When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m most likely out hiking South Mountain while
          enjoying a podcast, spending time with family, looking for new vinyl
          records to add to my collection, at a stand-up comedy show, or
          somewhere Googling architecture in a coffe shop enjoying some live
          music. ðŸ˜ƒ
